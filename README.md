# Weather Dashboard

## Overview ##

This is a simple weather dashboard using the server-side API, OpenWeather, to retrieve city data. The dashboard works by typing in the name of the city of your choice. The current weather data is then displayed on the larger card to the right. You will be able to see the name of the city searched, today's date, current temperature's icon, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. At the bottom of the page, you will see the forecast of that city for the next five days. Each forcast will have a date, temperature icon, predicted temperature and humidity for 3:00 pm each day.
